Families present numbers, both festive and fierce. The camera and the other performers are the only audience. —<jhailey@hotmail.com>",

Things only get worse when he delivers ice to the wrong room and ends up in a domestic argument at a really bad time. Next, he foolishly agrees to watch a gangster's kids for him while he's away.

He seamlessly interweaves cinema, politics, American society and culture, and film theory to inform, entertain, and move the viewer. Seberg's many marriages, as well as her film roles, are discussed extensively. Her involvement with the Black Panther Movement and subsequent investigation by the FBI is covered. Notably, details of French New Wave cinema, Russian Expressionist (silent) films, and the careers of Jane Fonda, Vanessa Redgrave, and Clint Eastwood are also intensively examined. Much of the film is based on conjecture, but Rappaport encourages viewers to re-examine their ideas about women in film with this thought-provoking picture. —Tad Dibbern <DIBBERN_D@a1.mscf.upenn.edu>",

"Storyline": "Moving from the big city (LA) to a backwater town is always difficult, but especially for the one doing the moving. After her dad's death, Beth Easton and her mother, Kate, move to the house left to the family by a deceased aunt. Kate meets up with several old friends, but Beth has none. Slowly, however, she makes friends, despite the lack of a nearby mall or anything else to do. Soon she meets up with two boys fighting ... except one isn't a boy, but a girl. The girl, Jody, is shunned by her peers as a 'bad kid.' As the film progresses, we see Jody as the apparent victim of a bad relationship between her own widowed mother and Ray, a man who, like everybody else, grew up in the town. Somehow, Beth sees that Jody isn't all that bad; 'she just needs a friend.' Beth sticks by her, even when Jody is blamed for almost killing Beth. Jody has a dream, though, a dream of finding lost gold in Bear Mountain, left there by a legendary woman named Molly Morgan. Jody has a map, and she has a 'condo' in the mountain near the entrance to a series of caves & tunnels leading to the supposed gold. On the first day of summer, Jody and Beth find the cave where the gold supposedly is hidden. The movie continues digging deeper into Jody's life through Beth's eyes. Although the legend of Bear Mountain is the prime motivator of several incidents, it's Jody's relationship to Ray, her mother, Beth, and the rest of the townspeople that provides the focus of the movie. —Joe Sewell <jsewell@iu.net>",

Goofy finds out about his son's antics (sort of), and decides a fishing trip, like his dad took him on, is the solution. Of course, he doesn't know that Max finally lands a date with Roxanne for a party thrown by the class valedictorian. Through the movie, Goofy tries to bring Max out of his shell, while Max resents being taken away, and lying to Roxanne about the trip (he tells her he & his dad will be appearing on TV at the PowerLine concert in LA). Will Max sink or swim? Will Goofy goof up his son's first shot at romance? Will Bigfoot step back? And what about those nuns? —Joe Sewell <jsewell@iu.net>",

"Storyline": "Henrickson plays Frank Morgan, a notorious and feared gunfighter that has lived his life on the run. His face and eyes reveal a man that has been very much hardened by that life. We quickly learn, however, that there is still passion inside. Upon receiving a telegram from Linda, an old lover (played by Kay Lenz), requesting his presence, he abandons his woman, mounts his horse and rides to Linda without giving it a second thought. Upon arrival, he learns that Linda is now happily married to the owner of the local general store. The only vestige of her past that remains is a daughter, who Frank is surprised to learn is his. The daughter, of course, does not know about Frank. Linda, not wanting her to know that her father was a notorious gunfighter has given her a fictional father that died a hero's death at the First Battle of Bull Run. Frank quickly learns that Linda's reason for calling for him has nothing to do with romantic feelings. She wants him to protect her husband. It seems that there was an attempted bank robbery in town and the local sheriff and one of the robbers was killed. The other robber is in jail, waiting to be hanged, and Linda's husband has been appointed to the job of temporary sheriff. A cousin of the prisoner is set to be released from prison in a few days, and has made it clear that he will do whatever is necessary to get his kin out of jail. Linda's husband believes that the town will back him up when the showdown comes, but Linda knows better. She knows that he will be killed unless Frank agrees to help him. The story unfolds as Frank comes to terms with the fact that Linda and, for that matter, his newly discovered daughter are forever beyond his reach. He must decide whether to help the man that now has the woman he loves or to simply ride away. —Dave Gan <longbow@bigfoot.com>",

Vinz, a Jew, Saïd, an Arab, and Hubert, a black boxer, have grown up in these French suburbs where high levels of diversity coupled with the racist and oppressive police force have raised tensions to a critical breaking point. During the riots that took place a night before, a police officer lost his handgun in the ensuing madness, only to leave it for Vinz to find. Now, with a newfound means to gain the respect he deserves, Vinz vows to kill a cop if his friend Abdel dies in the hospital, due the beating he received while in police custody. —b4arr2y",

But, one of them is an ex-con who's about to put the group on a collision course with death. Inspired by the events that spawned the New York Post headline, Headless Body in Topless Bar is an intense black comedy about a group of hostages held under the torment of a twisted gunman. The lonely, deranged killer leads the patrons through a bizarre, intriguing, and darkly humorous pop-psychotherapy session that's part truth or dare, part Russian roulette. As the searing drama develops, issues arise: the politics of gender, the effects of institutionalization, and the deadly dance between predator and prey. Who will survive? Candy the jaded stripper? Lumkin, the Wall Street sexual deviant? Carl, the wheelchair-bound regular? Or Vic and Creamface, the two loudmouth beer-chugging hockey buddies? Anything can happen with this madman in charge. —Clint Weiler",

"Storyline": "Danny Bara is one eleven-year-old girl who is nobody's fool. She lives at the track with her uncle Eddie, a horse trainer in the race circuit. Danny knows the horses. Danny knows the scams, and just how and when the races are fixed. Danny knows the odds makers-they depend on her for the inside story. And Danny knows that things are going to go nowhere for Uncle Eddie unless he can make his name with one great horse, a horse 'you can ride into the money.' Danny has found such a horse. Tom Thumb, a yearling up for sale, has champion potential and she knows it. She isn't fooled by Noel Ferguson, a big-time trainer who is talking Tom Thumb down. And when Moe Tully arrives in town, Danny knows it can only mean one thing-that races are going to be fixed. But there's opportunity in that for her. Placing her bets before school and picking up her winnings after, she is soon able to bankroll Uncle Eddie, along with her friend Gerald, a groom at a competing stable who is ready to stake his savings on Tom Thumb. When Danny's hunch proves correct and Tom Thumb turns out to be a winner, she, Uncle Eddie, and Gerald head off in style for the summer racing season. Other owners seek out the 'Bara magic' and for awhile Uncle Eddie can do no wrong. It's no surprise when Noel Ferguson offers Eddie fifty thousand dollars for Tom Thumb and tells him he'll take it if he knows what's good for him. When Eddie refuses, he and Danny, Gerald and even Tom Thumb get a dose of all the dirty dealing the racing circuit can dish out. But Danny, as we've seen, is nobody's fool, and even Uncle Eddie has picked up a thing or two lately. In spite of just about everything that comes their way, they're 'in the money' and it's one great season on the racing circuit. —Echo Bridge Home Entertainment",

Putting them all together, Omri locks the Indian inside the cabinet, only to be awoken by a strange sound in the middle of the night. Omri opens the cabinet to discover that the tiny Indian has come to life; it seems that he's called Little Bear (Litefoot), and he claims to have learned English from settlers in 1761. Omri hides this remarkable discovery from his mother but shares it with Patrick; as an experiment, Patrick locks a toy cowboy into the cupboard, and soon Little Bear has a companion, Boone (David Keith), though predictably, the cowboy and the Indian don't get along well at first. Omri comes to the realizations that his living and breathing playthings are also people with lives of their own, and he begins to wonder how much control he should really have over their lives.",

Every Sunday for the past year, they have hosted a dinner party, inviting a friend over to have an open-minded discussion about whatever topics are of interest. On a dark and stormy night when Pete was supposed to bring a friend for one of those dinners, he instead comes home with Zachary Cody, who rescued a stranded Pete whose car broke down. They invite Zach to stay for dinner instead of Pete's missing friend. They soon find out that Zach is among other things a racist neo-Nazi, which brings up a potentially dangerous situation for Jewish Marc and black Luke. After some physical altercations and verbal threats, Marc ends up stabbing Zach dead out of what he considers self-defense. As the friends discuss what to do about Zach, they finally come to the conclusion that in killing Zach, they have done society a service. So they ponder 'why not invite other ultra-conservatives with extreme views to dinner to do the same to them'? Several dinner parties and deaths later, they think they've hit the jackpot when they meet powerful ultra-conservative broadcaster Norman Arbuthnot, who they invite for dinner. But the friends' plans start to unravel when they can't agree on whether certain of their guests deserve to die. It is also threatened by Sheriff Alice Stanley, who is not looking for the five's victims, but is nevertheless nosing around as she works on a missing girl case. —Huggo",

"Synopsis": "An evil leprechaun finds himself in Las Vegas, where he proceeds to cause mischief by killing people, granting twisted wishes, and infecting a young man with his green blood.",
"Release Date": "June 27, 1995 (United States)",
"Storyline": "It was a normal night in Las Vegas, Nevada, all the lights were flashing brightly, until a man with one hand, one eye, and one leg walks into a pawn shop with a statue of a hideous looking Leprechaun. The owner claims it's a good luck charm. The statue also wore a medallion around it's neck. The careless pawn shop owner took off the medallion setting the Leprechaun free, along with his pot of gold that everyone wants and like before, he'll kill anyone who goes near it. Driving into town that night was a young man named Scott who was off to L.A. to go to school. Along the way he meets a sarcastic, but friendly, girl named Tammy. Scott tries gambling but loses everything, so he goes to the pawn shop to pawn his Rolex watch. At the shop, he finds the dead owner and one of Leprechaun's gold coins that grants a wish to its finder. Scott wishes for a winning streak, but what he does not know is that the casino is run by a crooked man who hates to lose. Also in the casino is an ignorant and dim magician Fazio and Loretta, a middle-aged gal. Before long, Leprechaun shows up to claim his coin, he bites Scott and in the process some of Leprechaun's green blood spills into Scott's wound, so before long Scott transforms into a tall Leprechaun and he needs some help! Only trouble is, the hospital doesn't accept his insurance company: Green Cross. The Leprechaun kills and mauls everyone in his path for his measly gold coin and Scott must choose whether to destroy the pot of gold as well as Leprechaun, or keep it and remain a Leprechaun himself. —Dylan Self <Robocoptng986127@aol.com>",

Later, Doug tries to make it work with Laura, but she is feeling ignored and there's a chance things might not work out. But Laura is quite reasonable in her concerns. Melissa won't accept that she can't have Doug and she turns into a stalker. In fact, her behavior turns very disturbing. Doug starts getting distracted and that could affect his future. Doug lost his father and his mother is still having a hard time getting over the loss. Melissa had a much more complicated relationship with her allegedly abusive parents. Is there something the viewer is not seeing? Or is the viewer seeing something that's just not there? Laura puts her investigative skills to work, but both she and Doug's mother may be in danger.

Grace Rhodes is the perfect corporate executive -- bright, successful, attractive and with just professional touch. With her career in place, Grace feels she has everything she needs -- until she bumps into an ex-boyfriend bearing photos of his young kids. Feeling the irresistible urge to have a child, but not sure about waiting around for Mr. Right,' Grace knows what she wants, but not how best to get it. Elaine, her wryly pragmatic best friend, suggests that Grace do the unthinkable and enlist the services of a sperm bank. After choosing a donor from the 'DNA menu,' Grace becomes pregnant and deeply curious about the identity of the donor #247. Enter Peter Kessler, a handsome photographer who divides his time between his craft, his casual affair with a married woman, and his 'other job:' depositing specimens as a sperm donor to earn a little extra cash. When Grace and Peter finally meet, they begin the journey down the rocky road to parenthood and possibly from there to love. —Rama <tarafilms.com>",

"Storyline": "College poetry professor and poet Rebecca Trager Lott's husband Ben Lott has just died in a freak accident. Rebecca's support during this difficult time consists of her best friend Sylvie Morrow, her sister Lucy Trager, and her ex-stepmother Alberta Trager. Earth mother Sylvie is dealing with what she sees as the probable end of her own marriage to her husband Paul Morrow. Chain smoking Lucy is a directionless and insecure woman who is still mourning their mother's death fourteen years earlier from cancer. And Wall Street executive Alberta, who Lucy in particular doesn't like in her life (especially as Alberta and their father have since divorced) is a domineering but admittedly efficient woman who treats her personal life as an extension of her professional life. As time progresses and each woman deals with her own issues while trying to help Rebecca, a hunky house painter who they have nicknamed 'Valentino' enters their collective lives. 'Valentino' profoundly affects each of their lives, at the same time that Rebecca, the only one who is seen as having had the perfect marriage, provides what they hope is sage advice for their issues. What comes into question is the appropriate time that Rebecca is allowed to feel sorry for herself.

He tried to escape, failed, and spent three years and two months in solitary confinement - in a dungeon, with no light, no heat and no toilet. Milton Glenn, the assistant warden, who was given free reign by his duty-shirking superior, was responsible for Young's treatment. Glenn even took a straight razor and hobbled Young for life. After three years and two months, Young was taken out of solitary confinement and put with the rest of the prisoners. Almost immediately, Young took a spoon and stabbed a fellow prisoner in the neck, killing him. Now, Young is on trial for murder, and if he's convicted he'll go to the gas chamber. An eager and idealistic young attorney, James Stamphill, is given this impossible case, and argues before a shocked courtroom that Young had a co-conspirator. The true murderer, he says, was Alcatraz. —J. Spurlin",

"Storyline": "Writer, Producer, and Director Oliver Stone's exploration of former President Richard Nixon's strict Quaker upbringing, his nascent political strivings in law school, and his strangely self-effacing courtship of his wife, Pat (Joan Allen). The contradictions in his character are revealed early, in the vicious campaign against Helen Gahagan Douglas and the oddly masochistic Checkers speech. His defeat at the hands of the hated and envied John F. Kennedy in the 1960 presidential election, followed by the loss of the 1962 California gubernatorial race, seem to signal the end of his career. Yet, although wholly lacking in charisma, Nixon remains a brilliant political operator, seizing the opportunity provided by the backlash against the antiwar movement to take the Presidency in 1968. It is only when safely in office, running far ahead in the polls for the 1972 Presidential election, that his growing paranoia comes to full flower, triggering the Watergate scandal. —alfiehitchie",

"Storyline": "During the American Civil War, a Union Army captain leads his rag-tag cavalry troop up a misty creek to a remote farm to appropriate enemy (Confederate) livestock. The farm is worked by Sarah Anders, whose husband is away fighting for the Confederate Army. Far from the great armies and battlefields, a very private civil war erupts. The Captain and Sarah are pulled apart by the war's undertow into choices they can not fully control or understand. Each character in this drama must decide whether loyalty will be paid in blood. This story has a relevance to current partisan conflicts. Armies are not filled with murdering psychopaths. Good people can be driven to do bad things. The story chronicles the pathology of war, how escalating events can trigger unasked-for tragedy. Based on a true story about a southern child who shot and killed a union soldier during the Civil War. —<jstanley@stern.nyu.edu>",

California housewife Carol White seems to have it all in life: a wealthy husband, a beautiful house, servants, beauty, and a lot of friends. The only thing she lacks is a strong personality: Carol seems timid and empty during all of her interactions with the world around her. At the beginning of the film, one would consider her to be more safe in life than just about anyone. That doesn't turn out to be the case. Starting with headaches and leading to a grandmal seizure, Carol becomes more and more sick, claiming that she's become sensitive to the common toxins in today's world: exhaust, fumes, aerosol spray, etc. She pulls back from the sexual advances of her husband and spends her nights alone by the TV or wandering around the outside of her well-protected home like an animal in a cage. Her physician examines her and can find nothing wrong. An allergist finds that she has an allergic reaction to milk but explains that there is no treatment for that sort of allergy. She sees a psychiatrist who does nothing but make her nervous. In the hospital, Carol sees an infomercial for Wrenwood, a new-age retreat for those who are 'environmentally ill,' and leaves her husband and stepson to try and find salvation at this retreat: headed by a phony, grandstanding, 'sensitive' individual named Peter Dunning. —David Eschatfische <esch@fische.com>",

While growing up he is considered strange by the other villagers and discovers his love of music, especially rebuilding and playing the organ at the village church. After experiencing an 'acoustic wonder', his eye color changes and he can hear even the most subtle sounds. Elias falls in platonic love with Elsbeth, the sister of Peter, a neighbor's son, who has longstanding homosexual feelings towards Elias. After Elsbeth, out of frustration from Elias' not returning her love and instead being obsessed with music, chooses to be impregnated and marries someone else who lose love she had spurned for Elias. The village burns and most villagers, including Elsbeth, evacuate to the closest town. Elias remains behind. A music master with the official task to register all the organs in the country arrives at the burnt village. There he discovers Elias' prodigy and invites him to an organ challenge in the town where the villagers relocated. Elias performs there and amazes the audience which includes Elsbeth. She is unable to meet with Elias before he is rushed to a waiting carriage. She calls to him and he hears her, but it is too late. Elias is taken on a brief tour by his mentors but soon returns to his spiritual site near the burnt village where he takes his own life (with Peter by his side), having decided to not sleep anymore. Elsbeth later returns there, a widow with a young daughter, hoping to find Elias but instead discovers his spiritual site has disappeared. —Thomas Meyer <i03a@zfn.uni-bremen.de>",

Colonel Hendricksson (Peter Weller) commands a handful of Alliance soldiers still alive on Sirius. Betrayed by his own political leaders and disgusted by the atrocities of a never-ending war, Hendricksson decides to negotiate a separate peace with the New Economic Bloc's decimated forces. But to do so, he will have to cross a treacherous wasteland where the deadliest threat comes from the very weapons he helped to create. —Nicolas LeBlanc <ei952859@uqac.uquebec.ca>",

Her tough, streetwise veneer is not as infallible as she would like, she, as she arrives in Vegas, becoming more cautious in the way she approaches strangers who seem willing to help her purely out of the goodness of their heart. Her talent and connections in combination are only able to get her a job at the Cheetah Club, a strip joint. Her first true friend in Vegas, Molly Abrams, works as the costumer for Goddess, the topless production at the Stardust. It is through Molly that Nomi catches the eye of Goddess' headliner, Cristal Connors. Nomi has a love/hate feeling toward Cristal: she doesn't much like her but wants to become her. Being at the Stardust, Nomi also catches the eye of Cristal's boyfriend, Zack Carey, Stardust's entertainment director. Through these contacts, Nomi is presented opportunity after opportunity to be part of the Stardust/Goddess family. She has to decide how far she will go to achieve her dream. James Smith, a struggling dancer/choreographer who works whatever odd jobs he can get and who is also attracted to Nomi largely for her natural albeit very raw talent, doesn't see Nomi's chosen path as the one she should pursue as he considers Goddess illegitimate: while the Cheetah is what it appears on the surface, Goddess is the Cheetah hiding behind its big name. Through it all, Nomi will discover the good, the bad and the very bad about Vegas life, especially among the rich and beautiful. —Huggo",

In Auggie Wren's (Harvey Keitel's) New York City smoke shop, day by day passes, seemingly unchanging until he teaches us to notice the little details of life. Paul Benjamin (William Hurt), a disheartened and broken writer, has a brush with death that is pivotal and sets up an unlikely series of events that afford him a novel glimpse into the life on the street which he saw, but did not truly perceive, every day. Finally, it's Auggie's turn to spin a tale. —Tad Dibbern <DIBBERN_D@a1.mscf.upenn.edu>",

Certainly not the police who raided the Stonewall Inn, a popular 'drag' bar in Greenwich Village. After a long history of police raids, extortion, and brutality, a gaggle of drag queens at the Stonewall decide they have had enough and begin to riot when the police try to load them into a paddy wagon. Told by 'La Miranda' (Hector), a regular customer at the Stonewall Inn, the film is a recounting of events that led up to that fateful day in 1969. 'Matty Dean' is the handsome angry young man that La Miranda meets at the Stonewall one day and with whom she/he quickly falls in love. 'Bostonia' is the self-styled Queen Mother of the drag queens and guides each initiate gently 'into the life.' Her lover, Vinnie, is the closeted proprietor of the Stonewall. His tragic response to the suffocation he feels bearing down on him from a homophobic world -- perhaps as much as anything else -- sparks the riots. This is the Stonewall Riots 'As Told By La Miranda'. —Mark Fleetwood <mfleetwo@mail.coin.missouri.edu>",

"Release Date": "October 29, 1995 (United States)",
"Storyline": "Set in the French Quarter of New Orleans during the restless years following World War Two, A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE is the story of Blanche DuBois, a fragile and neurotic woman on a desperate prowl for someplace in the world to call her own. After being exiled from her hometown of Laurel, Mississippi for seducing a seventeen-year-old boy at the school where she taught English, Blanche explains her unexpected appearance on Stanley and Stella's (Blanche's sister) doorstep as nervous exhaustion. This, she claims, is the result of a series of financial calamities which have recently claimed the family plantation, Belle Reve. Suspicious, Stanley points out that 'under Louisiana's Napoleonic code what belongs to the wife belongs to the husband.' Stanley, a sinewy and brutish man, is as territorial as a panther. He tells Blanche he doesn't like to be swindled and demands to see the bill of sale. This encounter defines Stanley and Blanche's relationship. They are opposing camps and Stella is caught in no-man's-land. But Stanley and Stella are deeply in love. Blanche's efforts to impose herself between them only enrages the animal inside Stanley. When Mitch -- a card-playing buddy of Stanley's -- arrives on the scene, Blanche begins to see a way out of her predicament. Mitch, himself alone in the world, reveres Blanche as a beautiful and refined woman. Yet, as rumors of Blanche's past in Laurel begin to catch up to her, her circumstances become unbearable. —Mark Fleetwood <mfleetwo@mail.coin.missouri.edu>",
