His mother died traveling in steerage. This leaves little Jackie Blair alone when he appears at Ellis Island, and the immigration officials want to send him right back. Captain Bill appears on the scene asking for a job - but he's too old and no one wants him. He sees lonely little Jackie, pities him and asks the eight Pinkosuwitz children to include him in their games. Thus, the Captain unwittingly engineers Jackie's escape. The orphan is mixed in with the Pinkosuwitzes when they leave the immigration building. When they find they've gained a ninth child, they send him on his way. This leaves Jackie to follow Captain Bill back to his very modest home - for which the old salt is unable to pay the rent. Jackie tries to make himself useful. He even sings and dances with an organ grinder to make money for the Captain's medicine. Little does either guess that Jackie's wealthy grandmother has everyone in immigration looking for the boy. When Jackie turns up at the matron's party for unfortunate children, he may be reunited with her. Or he may go to jail when he's suspected of stealing her hand-bag. —J.

He'd been an enormous star in early silent cinema, influencing the style of such subsequent silent comedy luminaries as Charles Chaplin and Buster Keaton. But his health suffered after he was gassed fighting for France in World War I. Despite the support of Chaplin himself (among others), his subsequent career in America never reached the popular heights he had at home. The commercial failure of this final U.S. effort seems particularly bewildering now, since THE THREE MUST-GET-THERES holds up so well. This spoof has the antic star as Dart-in-Again, a rapier-wielding dandy with a lovelorn horse (pining for the cow it left behind in the country) and a tendency to make an idiot of himself whilst attempting to conquer the forces of tyranny. Making scant effort to hide its incongruous modern Southern California backdrops, the movie is full of gags both slapstick and absurdist. Critics gratefully received it at the time. Audiences?

Accepted into Tate College, Harold plans on emulating Speedy, including giving himself the nickname Speedy, to gain that popularity, not realizing that if he does so, he will be more the buffoon than the hero. To be the most popular student, he will have to outdo the current most popular student, football captain Chet Trask. Unaware Speedy's task is made all the more difficult when one of the upperclassmen, seeing how hard Speedy is trying to impress, does whatever he can to make Speedy look all the more ridiculous, all the while Speedy believing he is achieving his dream. The bully's efforts are made all the more easy as Speedy is able to buy his way to seeming popularity with the small nest egg he was able to accumulate from work. The one thing that Speedy may not be able to buy is his way onto the football team, which he is convinced is the only surefire way to becoming the campus hero, despite not realizing that he truly is not the football type. While Speedy remains unaware how he truly looks to his classmates, Peggy, the daughter of the owner of the rooming house where he is staying, is aware, she who is in love with him, and he with her. The love of a good woman may be able to provide Speedy with a clearer understanding of who he truly should be to impress, and\/or get his mind focused on other things other than being everyone's best friend. —Huggo","Genres":"Comedy, Family, Romance, Sport","Release Date":"September 20, 1925 (United States)","Language":"None, English","Production Companies":"The Harold Lloyd Corporation","Runtime":"1 hour 17 minutes","Certificate":"Not Rated","Rating":"7.6","Country of Origin":"United States","Plot Keywords":"posterposter on the wallnicknamecrossword puzzlecollege dean45 more","Year":"1925","Writers":" Sam  Taylor(story) Ted  Wilde(story) John  Grey(story)","Budget":"Not Available","Gross Worldwide":"$5,668,000","Image":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTU5MDQyMDg2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTY0MTA5MTE@._V1_.jpg"}

As played out on the stage of Monument Valley, long ago, tribes of Indians defeated the ancient cliff dwellers; then came the Europeans to conquer the Indians. Now, in the early 20th Century, a tribe of Navajo live on a reservation overseen by an Indian-hating agent, Booker. He and his men steal the best Indian horses for their own profit. Nophaie, a tribal leader, complains to Booker's higher-ups, but he is unable to gain fair treatment from the whites. When World War I breaks out, an Army captain comes west in search of the horses that Booker was supposed to have bought from the Indians for a fair price. Marian Warner, the teacher at the Indian School, has befriended Nophaie, teaching him to read; she convinces him that the Great War is a fight for a more just world, and that, when that world comes, the Indian will be better treated. Nophaie not only brings horses for the Army, he and many other Indians enlist, and distinguish themselves in battle. But when they come back after the war is over, they find life for Indians even worse than when they left. Surely, they feel, it is time to fight back. But Nophaie is not so sure. —George S.

Walthall, Percy Williams, Conrad Nagel, Polly Moran, Edna Tichenor, Claude King, Andy MacLennan, Allan Cavan, Jules Cowles","Synopsis":"The abandoned home of a wealthy man who supposedly committed suicide five years earlier is taken over by ghoulish figures - could they be vampires?","Director":"Tod Browning","Storyline":"When Roger Balfour is found shot dead in his London home, his death is declared a suicide by Inspector Burke of Scotland Yard, even though the executor of Balfour's estate, Sir James Hamlin, insists his friend never would have taken his own life. Five years later, the abandoned Balfour house comes to life again with the arrival of two sinister-looking tenants: a fiendish-looking man with pointed teeth, bulging eyes and a tall beaver hat, and a pale young woman in a long gown. The presence of the strangers prompts Sir James, who lives next door, to call in Inspector Burke again. Also living in the Hamlin household are the other people who were also present in Balfour's house the night he died: Sir James' nephew, Arthur Hibbs; the late Balfour's now-grown daughter, Lucille; and Williams, the butler. Burke expresses skepticism about Sir James' suspicions that the new neighbors might have been involved in Balfour's death, until strange things start happening: Balfour's body disappears from its tomb. The new maid, Smithson, tells a terrifying tale of being menaced in Lucille's bedroom by the stranger in the beaver hat. And a man spotted inside the Balfour house by Burke and Sir James looks distinctly like the late Roger Balfour. A skittish Arthur becomes convinced the neighbors are vampires. Burke takes Lucille aside, and tells her he doesn't believe her father committed suicide. He asks her to trust him. Burke also has a private talk with Arthur. Burke uses hypnosis to put Arthur into a trance, but learns nothing new about Balfour's death. That night, someone fires a shot into Arthur's room, but Arthur isn't there; instead, it's Burke who's slightly wounded. Lucille is abducted by the beaver-hatted man and the butler and brought to her former home. Sir James, acting at Burke's instruction, also shows up at the Balfour house; he's met out front by the beaver-hatted man, who puts him into a hypnotic trance. Arthur breaks into the Balfour house in an attempt to rescue Lucille; he's caught by Burke and a couple of detectives and locked away. It turns out the man with the beaver hat and pointed teeth was really a disguised Inspector Burke, who was aided at times by a double; Smithson, the maid, is an assistant detective; the mysterious young woman, a stage performer working for the police. Under Burke's hypnosis, Sir James re-creates his actions the night Roger Balfour died, with Lucille and the butler, Williams, playing themselves, and Burke's double playing the part of Balfour.

Peter O'Gaffney and one of his soldiers, privileged \"pretty boy\" W. Daingerfield Phelps III (who is always drawing caricatures), are captured and interred at a POW camp in Northern Germany near the end of WWI. Their relationship has always been an antagonistic one based on what Phelps sees as O'Gaffney pushing him around. O'Gaffney's rank is despite being wanted by the police back home as a con man. It is because of these differences that their resulting friendship at camp is so unlikely, the friendship based on both having the nerve to attempt to escape. On a snow-covered day, they do manage to escape, in part by stealing white robes to camouflage themselves against the snow. In their adventures and misadventures on the outside in trying to get to safety, those adventures which include being mistaken for Arab prisoners, they find themselves as stowaways on board a cargo ship headed to Arabia. It is there that they meet a beautiful Arab woman named Mirza, who they save from drowning. They are both immediately smitten by her, which is why they are so disappointed to learn that she is betrothed in an arranged marriage to the ruthless Shevket Ben Ali. As the two try to reach the safety of an American consulate, they also decide to try and liberate Mirza, which may be more dangerous than fighting in the trenches in the battlefields of France. —Huggo","Genres":"Adventure, Comedy, Romance","Release Date":"September 23, 1927 (United States)","Language":", Language, English","Production Companies":"The Caddo Company","Runtime":"1 hour 32 minutes","Certificate":"TV-G","Rating":"6.7","Country of Origin":"United States","Plot Keywords":"american consulateamerican soldiermarriage engagementspeaking englishgerman army52 more","Year":"1927","Writers":" Wallace  Smith(screen version) Cyril  Gardner(screen version) Donald  Mc Gibney(original story)","Budget":"Not Available","Gross Worldwide":"Not Available","Image":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTQ2ODg1Mzk5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDc0MjUzMjE@._V1_.jpg"}

He is actually a criminal with his arms intact. He and his accomplice, Cojo (a little person), are hiding from the police. Alonzo views his disguise as perfect, especially since it keeps from view an unusual deformity of his left hand that would immediately give him away as the criminal the police are searching for. Nanon, the daughter of Zanzi, the circus owner, is the target in his act. Although Alonzo is in love with her, Nanon's father despises him. Malabar, the circus strong man, is attracted to Nanon but she is repulsed by his uninhibited sexual advances and desire to touch and hold her. Her phobia extends to the touch of any man's hand. Alonzo feeds her fears in the hopes that Nanon will fall in love with him since he is \"armless.\" Because Zanzi discovers Alonzo really has arms, Alonzo kills him, but Nanon witnesses the killing without seeing Alonzo's face; however, she does see the telltale deformity of his left hand. As Alonzo continues to plot to steal Nanon away from Mirabar, Cojo makes him realize that she will hate him once she discovers he has arms---and the deformity showing that he is her father's murderer. Alonzo decides to have both his arms amputated, which he succeeds in doing through blackmailing a surgeon. While Alonzo is away recuperating from the surgery, Nanon gets over her fear of being touched and falls completely in love with Mirabar. Discovering this upon his return, Alonzo hatches a scheme to kill Mirabar as he attempts his latest, most dangerous stunt. —Patrick Robbins <elfdorado@sbcglobal.net>","Genres":"Drama, Horror, Romance, Thriller","Release Date":"June 4, 1927 (United States)","Language":"None, English","Production Companies":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM)","Runtime":"1 hour 3 minutes","Certificate":"Unrated","Rating":"7.8","Country of Origin":"United States","Plot Keywords":"aphephobiaknife throwerunrequited lovemusclemanarmless man19 more","Year":"1927","Writers":" Tod  Browning(story) Waldemar  Young(scenario) Joseph  Farnham(titles)","Budget":"$217,000","Gross Worldwide":"$4,841","Image":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTk3MjQ0MzYzMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDg1NDM4MTE@._V1_.jpg"}

The neighboring Shore and Crowninshield families of the American east coast have a long tradition of seafaring. Of Jeremiah Shore's four sons, the only one not at sea is the youngest, Joel Shore, solely because of his age. Joel has had a long friendship with the Crowninshield's daughter, Priscilla Crowninshield, that friendship which is now on the brink of romantic love as they become of age, although this new-found love is unspoken on both sides. Joel hopes that when his eldest brother, Mark Shore, captain of the Nathan Ross, returns home from his latest voyage, he will allow Joel to sail with him. Although Mark still sees Joel as the \"youngin'\" of the family, Joel, through slightly underhanded means, is able to convince Mark that he is man enough to become a sailor. Also on this layover at home, Mark notices that Priscilla has become a beautiful young woman, who he now wants to marry. Mark arranges the engagement with his father and Priscilla's father without Priscilla's knowledge. The public announcement of the engagement shocks both Joel and Priscilla, the latter who has no romantic interest in Mark. On the Nathan Ross' first sailing following the engagement, that sailing to Singapore, Captain Mark makes a decision that unwittingly sets off a series of events that jeopardize both his and Joel's lives, but also tests whether in this situation family and brotherly loyalty or being with the woman you love is more important. —Huggo","Genres":"Drama, Romance","Release Date":"April 7, 1928 (United States)","Language":"None, English","Production Companies":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM)","Runtime":"1 hour 25 minutes","Certificate":"Passed","Rating":"5.9","Country of Origin":"United States","Plot Keywords":"loveengagementbrothershipsingapore47 more","Year":"1928","Writers":" Ben  Ames  Williams(book \" All the  Brothers  Were  Valiant\") Ted  Shane(adaptation) Joseph  Farnham(titles)","Budget":"$290,000","Gross Worldwide":"Not Available","Image":"Not Available"}

The film follows a group of German schoolboys, talked into enlisting at the beginning of World War 1 by their jingoistic teacher. The story is told entirely through the experiences of the young German recruits and highlights the tragedy of war through the eyes of individuals. As the boys witness death and mutilation all around them, any preconceptions about \"the enemy\" and the \"rights and wrongs\" of the conflict disappear, leaving them angry and bewildered. This is highlighted in the scene where Paul mortally wounds a French soldier and then weeps bitterly as he fights to save his life while trapped in a shell crater with the body. The film is not about heroism but about drudgery and futility and the gulf between the concept of war and the actuality. —Michele Wilkinson, University of Cambridge Language Centre, <mw125@cus.cam.ac.uk>","Genres":"Drama, War","Release Date":"September 18, 1930 (Spain)","Language":"English, French, German, Latin","Production Companies":"Universal Pictures","Runtime":"2 hours 32 minutes","Certificate":"13","Rating":"8.1","Country of Origin":"United States","Plot Keywords":"1910ssoldiergerman armytrench warfaredeath188 more","Year":"1930","Writers":" Erich  Maria  Remarque(by) Maxwell  Anderson(adaptation & dialogue) George  Abbott(screen play)","Budget":"$1,200,000","Gross Worldwide":"Not Available","Image":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BNWZhYzk5NTQtZmViYS00ZjZlLTk0M2MtNWI4NGY4MGJkNmZmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjUwMzI2NzU@._V1_.jpg"}

Most of his students don't much like him, often ridiculing him by sending him unflattering anonymous notes and drawings. Dr. Rath learns that many of his boys often frequent a cabaret called the Blue Angel, which he believes is corrupting their impressionable young minds. He heads to the Blue Angel himself to catch the boys in the act, shame them into not going again, but also to ask the headlining performer, anglophone Lola Lola, to cease and desist performing her show. Over several visits, Rath is able to catch the boys, but he himself starts to fall for Lola, and she seemingly with him. His infatuation with her threatens his teaching career. Their relationship ends up not being what either envisioned, the question being how they will both deal with their disintegrating relationship and the reasons behind that disintegration. —Huggo","Genres":"Drama, Music","Release Date":"January 9, 1931 (Spain)","Language":"German, English, French","Production Companies":"Universum Film (UFA)UFA TonfilmUniversum Film (UFA)","Runtime":"1 hour 40 minutes","Certificate":"13","Rating":"7.7","Country of Origin":"Germany","Plot Keywords":"sexual attractionprofessorcabaretnightclub singernightclub61 more","Year":"1930","Writers":" Heinrich  Mann(adapted from a novel by) Carl  Zuckmayer Karl  Vollmöller","Budget":"$500,000","Gross Worldwide":"$4,410","Image":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BM2IzOGNjYmYtMGVmMS00MDNjLTk4OGEtZTk0NDBlMmY3NGExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzg1ODEwNQ@@._V1_.jpg"}

He then plans to take her to his father's estate to meet his relatives. His father, Lord Crayle, has summoned the immediate family to discuss how to prevent John from marrying beneath his station. When they meet Elsie, they are all shocked she is a commoner except cousin Edward, whose opinion is discounted, since he is involved with a married woman in Paris. After being queried, Elsie senses the meeting is senseless and starts to leave, but Edward persuades her not to accept defeat. Meanwhile, Elsie's father arrives and, although derided as a commoner by the family, agrees with them that the marriage is a mistake. He says that Elsie has only agreed to marry John because of the published engagement, and that she's not in love with him at all: she had turned him down twice a day for a year. He suggests that the family ask Elsie to wait six months, and to retire from the stage and stay with them. He is certain that Elsie will become so bored with John and country life, that she will run back to the stage. So Elsie stays, but she and Edward secretly fall in love during the next few months. He says he will give up the woman in Paris, who he had earlier said he would marry if he could. News comes over the radio, however, that the woman's husband died, leading Elsie to feel Edward has an obligation to go back to the woman and marry her. Although Edward is resolute in breaking with this woman, once he talks to her on the telephone, he has a hard time doing so. And John, too, has some ideas concerning his relationship with Elsie. —Arthur Hausner <genart@volcano.net>","Genres":"Romance, Comedy, Drama","Release Date":"May 24, 1930 (United States)","Language":", Language, English","Production Companies":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM)","Runtime":"1 hour 16 minutes","Certificate":"Passed","Rating":"6.0","Country of Origin":"United States","Plot Keywords":"radio newsfamily disapprovalactorenglandsociety4 more","Year":"1930","Writers":" Frederick  Lonsdale(from the play by) Hanns  Kräly(scenario) Claudine  West(dialogue adaptation)","Budget":"Not Available","Gross Worldwide":"Not Available","Image":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BZDU3YzQxMDAtODQwNy00ZDczLTg0YTEtMWQ2M2RhZmEyMjdiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDY3MzU2MDM@._V1_.jpg"}

However, with the aid of Dziga Vertov's brother, Boris Kaufman, this avant-garde short film evolved from an ordinary depiction of a coastal town into a caustic and sarcastic report of the \"real\" Nice, portraying the contrasting lifestyles of its inhabitants. Starting with a series of captivating aerial takes, Vigo's film continues with scenes that pivot around the sun-kissed Promenade des Anglais, and unexpected juxtapositions of poverty and wealth; modern architecture and garbage; the working poor and the idle rich. In the cosmopolitan city of Nice on the French Côte d'Azur, eye-catching tableaux of sharp and eternal antitheses invite us to take a look at the anatomy of a small world.
